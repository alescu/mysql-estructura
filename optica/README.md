Description - Statement of the exercise:
    An optician, called "Cul d'Ampolla", wants to computerize the management of customers and glasses sales.
    
    First of all, the optician wants to know who is the supplier of each of the glasses. In particular, you want to know about each supplier:
    the name
    The address (street, number, floor, door, city, postal code and country)
    phone
    Fax
    NIF.
    
    The optician's purchasing policy is that glasses of one brand will be bought from a single supplier (so you can get more good prices out of them), but they can buy glasses of several brands from one supplier. He wants to know about the glasses:
    the brand
    The graduation of each of the glasses.
    The type of mount (floating, paste or metallic).
    The color of the mount.
    The color of each glass.
    the price
    
    Of the customers you want to store:
    the name
    The postal address.
    the phone
    The email.
    The registration date.
    When a new customer arrives, store the customer who has been recommended by the establishment (as long as someone has recommended it).
    Our system must indicate who was the employee who sold each pair of glasses.
Technologies Used:

Requirements:
    A MySql or MariaDb database.
    
Installation:
    Run the sql file in the database prompt.
    
execution
    Running the sql file will create both the database and the project tables automatically.

Deployment:
    Download or clone the project and use the sql file.

Contributions:
    1. Fork the project:
    
    A "fork" is a copy of the project in your GitHub account. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original project.
    2. Clone the "fork" to your computer:
    
    This allows you to work on the project locally.
    3. Create a branch ("branch") for your changes:
    
    It's a good practice to create a separate branch for each change you make. This makes it easier to review and integrate your changes.
    4. Make the changes:
    
    Modify the project files with any improvements or fixes you want to make.
    5. Commit the changes:
    
    A "commit" is a record of the changes you've made. Write descriptive messages to explain what you changed.
    6. Put the changes in your "fork":
    
    This updates your fork with the changes you made locally.
    7. Send a "pull request":
    
    A pull request is a request to incorporate your changes into the original project. 
    The project manager will review your changes and accept them (or ask you to make changes) if everything is correct.
    
    Additional tips:
    Read the project instructions: Many projects have a README or CONTRIBUTING file with specific instructions for contributing.
    Communicate with those responsible for the project: If you have doubts or questions, do not hesitate to contact them.
    Be respectful and constructive: Collaboration on open source projects is a community activity.
    Don't get discouraged if your changes aren't accepted the first time: Code review is an iterative process.
